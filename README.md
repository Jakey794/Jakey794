# Hey there 👋

I'm Jacob, a machine learning engineer based in Toronto.

I work primarily in machine learning and software engineering, with a strong focus on **financial time-series modeling**, **AI-driven systems**, and **end-to-end ML projects**. Most of my work is done using Python and PyTorch, with an emphasis on understanding systems deeply.

This GitHub serves as a portfolio of **full ML / SWE projects**, financial AI experiments, group ML contributions, and side projects. Everything here is built intentionally

## A Bit About Me

- 🐕 I have a black dog  
- 🏊 I enjoy swimming and staying active  
- 🏀 Big sports fan — always happy to talk about games and stats   
- 📺 *Brooklyn Nine-Nine* is a favorite

## Philosophy

I believe **learning comes from doing** — building real systems, breaking them, and understanding why they work. I aim to create projects that are practical, well-reasoned, and easy to understand, even when the underlying ideas are complex.
